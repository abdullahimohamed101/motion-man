## Now
- Active plan: `docs/plans/ui.md` (Active; step 1 done, U2 PASS). CLI MVP in review: PR #1, `docs/plans/done/cli-mvp.md`.
- Branch: `feat/ui`, stacked on `feat/cli-mvp` (PR #1, open). `feat/project-docs` is superseded.
- Env: `.venv` (py3.11.17); `yolo11n.pt` and `clips/crosswalk.mp4` local and gitignored (README has the commands)

## Next step (exact)
1. UI step 2: `pipeline.run` optional `on_progress` callback (≤ every 0.25 s) + record BaseException exits by name; tests.
2. Owner reviews and merges PR #1 (never merged by an agent); rebase `feat/ui` on `main` afterwards.

## Blocked / needs owner
- PR #1 review and merge

## Last check
- `scripts/check.sh`: ruff ok, 78 passed. Crosswalk benchmarks: exit 0 ×3, median 32.14 fps (CPU, battery).
